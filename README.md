<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan.</h1>

I mostly dabble in signal, image and video processing (quality assessment), computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. 
Primarily working on satellite data processing right now. 

## Current Work
I am trying to build a high-level open-source library for image processing algorithms (Something simpler than OpenCV and written in Python. More like scikit-image). Check out [PyPixie](https://www.github.com/pneycho/pypixie).

## Contact
I do check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyansanyal/) messages.
