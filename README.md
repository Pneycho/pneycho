<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan.</h1>

I mostly dabble in signal,image and video processing (Quality Assessment), computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. 
Primarily working on satellite data processing right now. 

## Current Work
I am trying to build an extremely high-level open-source library for image processing algorithms (Think more abstraction than OpenCV). Check out [PyPixie](https://www.github.com/pneycho/pypixie).

## Contact
I do check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyansanyal/) messages.
