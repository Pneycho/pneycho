<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan.</h1>

A researcher with a focus on signal, image, and video processing (mostly quality assessment). I also dabble in computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. 
Primarily working on satellite data processing right now. 

## Current Work
I am trying to build OSS to serve as a high-level library for image processing algorithms (Think more abstraction than OpenCV). Check out [PyPixie](https://www.github.com/pneycho/pypixie)

## Contact
I do check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyansanyal/) messages.
