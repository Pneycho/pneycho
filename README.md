<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Computer Vision Researcher.</h3>

Hey there! I'm a researcher with a focus on signal, image, and video processing (especially quality assessment). I also dabble in computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. If you're into that sort of thing, you're in the right place! Check out my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/shreyansanyal/home) to learn more about my work and research interests.
