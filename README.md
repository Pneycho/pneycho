<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan.</h2>

I mostly dabble in signal, image and video processing (quality assessment), computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. 
Currently working on satellite data products in both the geometry and radiometry aspects. 

## Current Work
As a personal project, I am trying to build a image-processing tool with GIS support. Somewhere between Photoshop and QGIS, but with a better UI. ImagePy is close, but its focused on bio-image analysis, so...

## Contact
I do check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyansanyal/) messages.
