<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shreyan.</h1>

I mostly dabble in signal, image and video processing (quality assessment), computer vision, data science, natural language processing, art and anatomy. 
Primarily working on satellite data processing right now. 

## Current Work
As a personal project, I am trying to build a image-processing tool with GIS support. Somewhere between QGIS and ImageJ, but with a better UI. 

## Contact
I do check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyansanyal/) messages.
